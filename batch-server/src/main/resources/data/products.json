It featured a whole new type of synthesis called FM (Frequency Modulation). It certainly is not analog and it is difficult to program but can result in some excellent sounds! It is difficult because it is non-analog and thus, a whole new set of parameters are available for tweaking, many of which seemed counter-intuitive and unfamiliar. And programming had to be accomplished via membrane buttons, one data slider and a small LCD screen. Still the sounds it shipped with and that many users did manage to create were more complex and unique than anything before it. Percussive and metallic but thick as analog at times, the DX7 was known for generating unique sounds still popular to this day. The DX7 was also a truly affordable programmable synth when it was first released. Almost every keyboardist bought one at the time making the DX7 one of the best selling synths of all time! It also came with MIDI which was brand new at the time - Sequential had already released the first MIDI synth, the Prophet 600. Roland had just released the JX-3P with very basic MIDI implementation, and wouldn't get around to adding full MIDI for another year with the Juno-106, and it would be three years before Roland can counter the popularity of the DX7 with a digital synth of their own, the D-50."], "fit": "", "title": "Yamaha Dx7 Digital Synthesizer", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "Yamaha", "feature":

{"category": ["Musical Instruments", "Instrument Accessories", "Guitar &amp; Bass Accessories", "Stands"], "tech1": "", "description": ["This A-frame is designed to adjust the angle of the guitar neck to aid in perfect positioning for playing. Highly recommended by Aaron Shearer. The A-Frame adjustable guitar support is simple to use, yet offers a greater variety of positioning than has ever been available for the guitarist. The ability to make adjustments to 3 separate aspects of positioning, and then lock them into your optimum playing position is a unique feature of the A-Frame. Basically there are three adjustments: Left or right adjustments, angle adjustment, and height adjustment. ***Note: The finish on a small number of guitars may react with the suction cups on the a-Frame, and leave a mark on the finish that will not wipe off. The vast majority of finishes have no adverse reaction to the suction cups. During the first few weeks of use, you inspect the finish regularly and contact Sageworks if you notice a problem. A refund would be available through the supplier for anyone who has this problem.

It is easy to play and produces a clear, crisp, clean, sound with good volume. It also takes very little air to produce a beautiful tone. Because of its excellent playability it is well suited for the serious musician and novice alike. The Sweetone Tinwhistle has a tapered bore. The tapered sides of the whistle have the effect of bringing the finger holes closer together and increasing the range and accuracy of the higher notes. A fingering chart and song sheet is included with each whistle.
